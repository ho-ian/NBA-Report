# NBA-Report

This is a PowerBI personal project of mine.
In this project, I leveraged a Python library named nba_api
in order to gather the necessary data to complete this dashboard.

I wanted to develop something that could quickly and easily tell me
specialized stats about every NBA team over the years and I found that
there was nothing on the internet that would discern that information. 

As a test project, I created this dashboard to display a team's and
their players' performances against every NBA team. The data collected
is from the past 10 seasons/years and it can be filtered through season
type (playoffs or regular) and by date ranges.

This dashboard quickly highlights the win/loss ratio for the specific team
and displays the important statlines for each player on the team.

Below is an example of the dashboard in use.
